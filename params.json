{"body":"NTable is a Ruby library that provides a convenient data structure for storing n-dimensional tabular data.\r\n\r\nIt works with zero-dimensional scalar values, arrays, tables, and any arbitrary-dimensional hypertables. Each dimension is described by an axis object. The \"rows\" in that dimension might be identified by numbers or names. You can perform slice operations across any dimension, as well as reductions and dimensional decomposition. Finally, serialization is provided via a custom JSON schema, as well as a simple \"hash of hashes\" or \"array of arrays\" approach.\r\n\r\nInstall NTable as a gem:\r\n\r\n    gem install ntable\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\n\r\n* See the [documentation](http://dazuma.github.com/ntable/rdoc)\r\n* Source code on [Github](http://github.com/dazuma/ntable)\r\n* Report issues [here](http://github.org/dazuma/ntable/issues)\r\n","name":"Ntable","tagline":"N-dimensional table data structure for Ruby","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
